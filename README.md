# command-line-pandemic
Command-line version of the board game "Pandemic." 
Initialized with base game cities, connections, and roles - it is straightforward to add cities, connections, event cards, etc.
This project was created for fun and to practice writing software. I welcome any and all feedback.
If you somehow manage to enjoy this version, you'll love the real thing: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic
